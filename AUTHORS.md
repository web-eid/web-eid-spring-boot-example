task of building a minimal web application using web-eid.js library.

## Martin Ott

Generating the project using Spring Initalizr and implementing user authentication using Spring Security.

## Juri Letberg

Document signing and Cache for used nonce values.

## Mart SÃµmermaa

Coordinating the example project with the rest of the Web eID project. Also polishing the example application - starting with writing documentation and ending with Docker compose scripts enabling easier deployment.
